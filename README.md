# A-TCP-based-socket-communication-system

- This is a communication system using socket programming techniques.
- It includes a server and clients, which can realize online chatting. 
- The server could supports multiple clients. It assigns multiple userThreads to process each connected client. 
- And I use Wireshark to capture and analyze the transmitting packets.
